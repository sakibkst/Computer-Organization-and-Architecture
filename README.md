# Computer Organization and Architecture

This Course provides insights into the principles of computer organization and architecture, focusing on the foundational concepts, components, and system functionalities. It aims to explore how computers are structured, operate, and interact with software and hardware.


## Key Topics

### 1. **Basic Concepts**
   - **Von Neumann Architecture:**
     - Explains the structure of a computer with shared memory for data and instructions.
   - **Harvard Architecture:**
     - Highlights separate memory for instructions and data for faster processing.

### 2. **CPU Design**
   - **Control Unit (CU):** Directs operations of the processor.
   - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
   - **Registers:** Temporary storage within the CPU for quick data access.

### 3. **Memory Hierarchy**
   - **Primary Memory:**
     - RAM and Cache for high-speed access.
   - **Secondary Memory:**
     - Storage devices like HDDs and SSDs.
   - **Virtual Memory:** Extends RAM using storage space.

### 4. **Instruction Sets**
   - **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):**
     - Rich instruction set for diverse operations.
   - **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):**
     - Optimized for efficiency with simpler instructions.

### 5. **Input/Output Systems**
   - **I/O Interfaces:**
     - Connect peripherals to the CPU.
   - **DMA (Direct Memory Access):**
     - Allows devices to communicate with memory directly, bypassing the CPU.

### 6. **Pipeline and Parallel Processing**
   - **Pipelining:** Executes multiple instruction phases simultaneously.
   - **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes multiple processors for simultaneous task execution.

### 7. **Cache Memory**
   - Explains cache levels (L1, L2, L3) and their role in reducing access time.

### 8. **Bus Systems**
   - **Data Bus:** Transfers data between components.
   - **Address Bus:** Carries memory addresses.
   - **Control Bus:** Sends control signals.

### 9. **Performance Metrics**
   - **Clock Speed:** Determines the speed of processing cycles.
   - **MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second):** Measures execution speed.
   - **Throughput:** Evaluates system performance under load.
